**This exercise is to plot a line chart using pygal. The data is given as json format, which is 2017 Bitcoin price info. ["btc_close_2017.json"](<https://github.com/New-Be-Maker/Introduction-to-Python/blob/main/Part2_Small%20Projects/Raw%20Data/btc_close_2017.json>). The suggested solution is ["bitcoin_close_price_chart.py"](<https://github.com/New-Be-Maker/Introduction-to-Python/blob/main/Part2_Small%20Projects/Codes/bitcoin_close_price_chart.py>).**

**p.s. It is also good to use updated current data, but API is to be learned first.**

## Phase 1: To draw a simple line chart

### Step 1
check you json file and it is a very long **List** and each element is a dictionary.What we want are those values in dictionary.So,we use `for...in` to extract all values from dictionaries.

Because everything in this **List** is string. We need to make some values interger first(because when we draw graph, pygal can only deal with **int** or **float** type. Here we notice that the close price is decimal number, we need to first `float` it and then `int` it.

### Step 2
In the end, the X-aixs is date and Y-aixs is price. Both date and price should be a very long **List**ï¼ˆwhy List here?). So, we need to create relevant empty **Lists** and fill them.

### Step 3
The final step is to draw this chart. we use pygal. It is the best to learn from internet about codes related to pygal.
