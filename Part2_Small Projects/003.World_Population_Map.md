**This exercise is to visualize world population distribution by using Pygal. We will use a given json file ["population_data.json"](<https://github.com/New-Be-Maker/Introduction-to-Python/blob/main/Part2_Small%20Projects/Raw%20Data/population_data.json>) to draw a world map with population distribution. Make sure pygal has been installed in your Python script.
p.s. It is totally fine to use API and online resrouce to get data, but it is not the key part of this exercise.**
