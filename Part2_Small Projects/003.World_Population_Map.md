**This exercise is to visualize world population distribution by using Pygal. We will use a given json file ["population_data.json"](<https://github.com/New-Be-Maker/Introduction-to-Python/blob/main/Part2_Small%20Projects/Raw%20Data/population_data.json>) to draw a world map with population distribution. Make sure pygal has been installed in your Python script.**

**p.s. It is totally fine to use API and online resrouce to get data, but it is not the key part of this exercise.**

## Step 1

Check json file first. In this file, it is a very long **List** with a lof of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents one country and some info. about this country is there. What we want are Values(population) and Country Code.

Then we import moudules and tools needed. Google `pygal` for more info. about it.
```python
import json
import pygal
from pygal_maps_world.i18n import COUNTRIES
from pygal_maps_world.maps import World
from pygal.style import RotateStyle
from pygal.style import LightColorizedStyle
```
## Step 2

Our final goal is to draw a world population map. So, the final data format should be a dictionary. 

**e.g. Population = {'China':'1000','USA':'300'}** So,the second step is to extract raw data and deal with it to Country(Code) and their population value.

## Step 3

Using Pygal to set graph format and output. (It is better to read some online examples than explain it here)
